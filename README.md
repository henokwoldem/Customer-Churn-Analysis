## Project Proposal: Customer Churn Analysis
Project Overview
Build a self-contained Customer Churn Analysis that demonstrates the full analytics lifecycle:

Data Ingestion & Storage

Import raw customer data (e.g., Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle) into a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).

Write SQL scripts to create tables and load CSV data.

Data Cleaning & ETL

Use Python (pandas) to identify and handle missing values, outliers, and duplicate records.

Develop an ETL pipeline (using Python or an Airflow/DAG-like script) that pulls, cleans, and writes curated data back to your database or as clean CSVs.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform statistical summaries and visual EDA in Jupyter notebooks.

Identify key features correlated with churn (e.g., tenure, service usage, contract type).

Predictive Modeling

Implement at least two classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) in scikit-learn.

Evaluate models using ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and cross-validation.

Select and tune the best model for deployment.

Dashboard & Reporting

Develop an interactive Tableau (or Power BI) dashboard that visualizes customer segments, churn rates, and model predictions.

Embed key performance indicators (KPIs) and a “what-if” scenario tool (e.g., adjusting contract type to see churn probability).

Documentation & Presentation

Prepare a slide deck summarizing your approach, findings, and recommendations for reducing churn.

Host your code on GitHub with a clear README, project structure, and instructions for reproduction.
